## üß™ Testing

To test the system:

1. Ensure your webcam is working
2. Run the application
3. Position your face in the camera view
4. Try different facial expressions
5. Monitor the emotion detection accuracy

## ü§ù Contributing

We welcome contributions! Please:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Webcam not detected:**
- Check if webcam is connected and working
- Ensure no other application is using the webcam
- Try running as administrator (Windows)

**Low FPS:**
- Close unnecessary applications
- Reduce frame resolution in the code
- Check system resources

**Installation errors:**
- Update pip: `pip install --upgrade pip`
- Install Visual C++ build tools (Windows)
- Use conda instead of pip if needed
