- **High Performance**: Optimized for maximum FPS with efficient processing
- **Modern GUI**: Dark-themed Tkinter interface with responsive design
- **Live Monitoring**: Real-time FPS counter and performance metrics
- **Emotion Trends**: Analysis and visualization of emotion patterns
- **Confidence Scoring**: Detailed confidence scores for each detected emotion
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## üìã Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Webcam access
- Sufficient RAM (4GB+ recommended)
- GPU support (optional, for enhanced performance)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Prerequisites

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/facial-emotion-recognition.git
   cd facial-emotion-recognition
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (recommended)
   ```bash
   # Windows
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate

   # macOS/Linux
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Dependencies

The following packages will be installed:
- `opencv-python>=4.8.0` - Computer vision and video processing
- `deepface>=0.0.79` - Deep learning-based emotion recognition
- `numpy>=1.21.0` - Numerical computing
- `Pillow>=9.0.0` - Image processing

## üéØ Usage

1. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Using the GUI**
   - Click **‚ñ∂ Start Detection** to begin real-time emotion analysis
   - View detected emotions and confidence scores on the video feed
   - Monitor live FPS and performance metrics
   - Click **‚èπ Stop Detection** to end the session

3. **Performance Tips**
   - Ensure good lighting for better accuracy
   - Position your face clearly in the camera view
   - Close unnecessary applications to free up system resources

## üìä Features in Detail

### Emotion Recognition
- **7 Emotion Categories**: Happy, Sad, Angry, Fear, Disgust, Surprise, Neutral
- **Confidence Scoring**: Each emotion comes with a confidence percentage
- **Real-time Processing**: Continuous analysis with minimal latency

### Performance Optimizations
- **Frame Skipping**: DeepFace analysis runs every 10th frame for optimal FPS
- **Efficient Memory Management**: Optimized data structures and cleanup
- **Threading**: Smooth UI updates without blocking video processing
- **Frame Resizing**: Automatic resizing for better performance

### User Interface
- **Dark Theme**: Modern, eye-friendly interface
- **Real-time Stats**: Live FPS counter and emotion display
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Status Indicators**: Clear feedback on system status

## üîß Configuration

### Customization Options

You can modify the following parameters in `app.py`:

```python
# Emotion update interval (seconds)
self.emotion_update_interval = 0.8

# Frame resize dimensions
frame = cv2.resize(frame, (640, 480))

# GUI window size
self.root.geometry('1000x800')
```

### Performance Tuning

- **Increase FPS**: Reduce `emotion_update_interval` or frame resolution
- **Improve Accuracy**: Increase `emotion_update_interval` for more frequent analysis
- **Memory Usage**: Adjust frame buffer size based on available RAM
